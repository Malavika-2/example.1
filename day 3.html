                  across countries, cultures, and communities. From simple online forums to advanced social networking platforms,
                  social media has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Understanding the history of social media helps
                   us see how digital communication has transformed human interaction.</p>
                <h2><u>Early Beginnings of Online Communications<span>(1970-1990)</span></u></h2>
                <p>The roots of social media can be traced back to the early days of the internet. In the 1970s and 1980s, people
                    communicated through emails and bulletin board systems (BBS). These platforms allowed users to share messages 
                    and information in online communities.<br>In the 1990s, the internet became more popular, and chat rooms and 
                    instant messaging services such as IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) emerged. These 
                    tools laid the foundation for modern social networking</p>
